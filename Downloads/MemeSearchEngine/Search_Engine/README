INSTALL  
=======
1. First make sure pylucene is installed and can be found on PYTHONPATH.  

2. The indexer is called parse.py. It can be run like: 
    `python parse.py <path to image->ocr file> <path to image->labels file> <path to index>`

   For example (using the provided files) (make sure a directory called index exists):
    python parse.py image2text labels index
    
   The image->ocr file is output by the OCR.ipynb file.
   The image->labels file is output by the Meme_Classifier/generate_labels.lua file.
    
3. Download the crawled images tar file from this url: https://www.dropbox.com/s/lyfbz2bmlf7yzgc/common_image_base.tar.gz. It's approximately 450 MBs in size.

4. Extract it in the directory in which this README is located. Make sure its name is "common_image_base". Also, make sure untarring doesn't create nested folders. All the crawled images should be directly under "common_image_base". This is necessary for links to work. 

5. Don't disturb the file structure of the other files to make sure the links work. 

6. Modify index path in search.cgi if needed. 

7. Now run a cgi server on your system with present working directory as the directory in which this file (README) is contained:
    `python -m CGIHTTPServer`
    
8. Browse to:
    `localhost:8000/search.html`
