INSTALL
=======
Look at the README in the Search_Engine folder to run the actual search engine. The report can be found in the file called "MemeSearch.pdf". To view the itorch and ipython notebooks install jupyter.

Description of attached files
=============================
Search_Engine - Directory contains files related to the actual search engine. Use the README in this folder for information on how to run the search engine.
MemeCrawler.py - File to crawl subreddits for memes. We assume the subreddits only contain memes.
MemeTypeCrawler.py - File crawls imgflip.com for meme categories and corresponding blank images.
OCR.ipynb - iPython notebook to demonstrate the usage of Microsoft OCR API.
Meme_Classifier/Feature_Generation.ipynb - iTorch notebook to demonstrate feature generation from memes generated via memegen.
Meme_Classifier/Train_and_Test.ipynb - iTorch notebook to demonstrate training and testing of meme classifier. 
Meme_Classifier/gen_labels.lua - Uses the trained classifier to generate labels for images crawled from subrredits. 
https://github.com/mayanks43/memegen - The meme generator we used to generate images per meme category given a blank image.

OCR Pipeline
============
1. Use MemeCrawler.py to crawl subreddits for meme images. Save these files in a folder called common_image_base. We also provide our crawled images on dropbox. Download it as follows:
    
    $ wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/lyfbz2bmlf7yzgc/common_image_base.tar.gz
    
2. Use OCR.ipynb to extract texts from the images in common_image_base folder. This is saved as image2text file in the Search_Engine folder.

Meme Classifier Pipeline
========================
1. Use MemeTypeCrawler.py to download meme image categories in folder. 

2. Clone memegen (linked above). Install any requirements and run the script run_all.sh to generate dataset for classification. 

3. Use Feature_Generation.ipynb to generate features for the classifier dataset (saved in "meme_features.t7"). Note that you'll need a GPU and torch installed to be able to run this iTorch notebook. You can run this on CPU as well if you replace the gpu specific statements. 

4. Use Train_and_Test.ipynb and meme_features.t7 to train a logistic classifier on the meme image categories crawled in the 1st step. You'll get a model file called "memeclassifier" as output. 

5. Now, use generate_labels.lua and "memeclassifier" to generate labels for images crawled from the subreddits. This is saved as labels file in the Search_Engine folder.

Search Engine Pipeline
======================
Refer to README present in the Search_Engine folder for this.

Hope you like it!
